            <p> Hello! I'm Marcus Chung. I'm a second year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto, looking to join the Biomedical Engineering stream and eventually get accepted into Med School.</p>
            <p>Helping others has been a really important part of my life since I was young, and throughout highschool I did a lot of volunteering with elderly patients in Hospitals and Care Centers. Especially given how Alzheimer's is really prevalent in my family, I want to become a Psychiatrist to aid the people I care about. Right now I'm looking for research oppurtunities that will help me do that, or internships that allow me to use my data science skills.</p>

                <p>Hello! My name is Marcus Chung and I'm a second year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto. I have a keen interest in both psychiatry and data science, and am looking for ways to combine the two. During high school, I volunteered a lot in hospitals and elderly care centers and got to hear from a lot of patients about how their illness affected their lives. I ended up continuing to read book and listen to podcasts about mental illnesses and psychiatry grew into an area I became very invested in, especially as diseases like Alzheimer's are very common in my family. A particular topic I'm interested in is using data to dispel or correct past misinformation and stereotypes about mental conditions. I'm currently looking for research oppurtunities</p>
                <p>As for other projects, I'm currently trying to make my own game. Growing up, I loved stories. I spent much of my time playing video games, reading books, and volunteering at places where I could talk to new people, and hear about their lives. Making my own stories has been a dream of mine for a long time, and the first chapters start now.</p>
